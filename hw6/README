To run this program, you have to start with the server file first then the client file.
You will get a prompt to enter a username, it must be under 20 characters.
For the client to quit from the server enter "/quit" to leave

NOTES:
	-Didn't handle a case where user sends signal to client


CHANGES:

Changes made to client file: Essentially the changes made so that the client works

	-fd_set is only the reading set, reads from stdin and the connected socket
	
	-additional read and writes are added to allow the client to send their username to
	the server and to recieve the incoming welcome message from the server

	-client does not take any input from user, no way to change ip address or port number
	***** This means that the ip address is 127.0.0.1 with the port number 8080 *****

	-server also does not take in any input from the user, hard coded with the same ip
	address and port number 

	-added string manipulation for the messaging to include the username when client sends
	a message


Server Features:

	-Crude message log
		-Displays the chatroom messages with their corrisponding user and displays the socket
		the client uses
	
	-Quitting cross platforms
		-The quit command is supported for any machine (windows vs other). On window machines
		"/quit" == "/quit\r\n" and for other machines "/quit" == "/quit\n". 

	-Connected vs Disconnected Updates
		-The server will be notified when a client connects or disconnects. An output is provided
		when a client leaves or joins.

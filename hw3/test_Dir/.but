waht is this. I mean seriously, I have no idea what am I typing in this file, yet I'm still typing with proper grammer and spelling. Maybe this is practice for me to 
type faster and hopefully have a much faster word count per minute. But one can only hope. Jesus man I still have to type more things so that this file can accutally 
take up a single disk block. GOD DANG IT MAN, the time for typing ends NOW. GIBERISH TIME: ADFHAJSLDJFALKELA WNERHAW;EJR LAKSJFA S;DLKJFLWJIO235LK23LKNR QWLJ 3QJL KRQWKLEMR
